## Welcome to exploration and analysis of the auto mpg data set ##

Welcome to this my python notebook created for exploration and analysis of the Auto- MPG data-set. The dataset is fairly standard on kaggle but can be accessed separately from the UCI Machine Learning Repository along with many other interesting datasets. Check http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php for more.

We can see that the dataset has the following columns (with their type):

mpg: continuous
cylinders: multi-valued discrete
displacement: continuous
horsepower: continuous
weight: continuous
acceleration: continuous
model year: multi-valued discrete
origin: multi-valued discrete
car name: string (unique for each instance)

## Welcome to exploration and analysis of the auto mpg data set ##

Welcome to this my python notebook created for exploration and analysis of the Auto- MPG data-set. The dataset is fairly standard on kaggle but can be accessed separately from the UCI Machine Learning Repository along with many other interesting datasets. Check http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php for more.

We can see that the dataset has the following columns (with their type):

mpg: continuous
cylinders: multi-valued discrete
displacement: continuous
horsepower: continuous
weight: continuous
acceleration: continuous
model year: multi-valued discrete
origin: multi-valued discrete
car name: string (unique for each instance)

## About the Dataset
The Dataset contains 398 rows Ã— 9 columns.This dataset is taken from Kaggle.

## Structure of Project:

### Task 1: Load the Data and Import Libraries

      * Load the dataset using pandas.
      * Import essential modules and helper functions
      * Explore the dataframe using the head().
      
### Task 2: Inspect the Data

       * Explore the dataframe using the shape, info() functions.
       * Check the null values
       * Get Statistical Overview using describe()
       
### Task 3: Visualize the Data(EDA)

  For this dataset, I used a  barplot(), pairplot(), scatorplot(), boxplot() using Seaborn & Matplotlib to visualize the data Pandas functions used to analyse data

### Task 4: Data-Analysis:

 Analyse the Dataset based on these visualizations.

In this I made a simple Quiz game which consist of 3 question and answers related to python.Here i Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true. Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false. Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.

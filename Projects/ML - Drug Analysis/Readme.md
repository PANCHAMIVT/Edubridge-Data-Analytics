## About the Dataset ##
Imagine that you are a medical researcher compiling data for a study. You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.

Part of your job is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The features of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and the Cholesterol of the patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.

It is a sample of multiclass classifier, and you can use the training part of the dataset to build a decision tree, and then use it to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to prescribe a drug to a new patient.

## Objectives
After completing this we will be able to:

Build a model predict the outcome of the drugs that might be accurate for the patient
In this lab exercise, you will learn machine learning algorithm. You will use this classification algorithms to build a model from the historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then you will use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
Prediction models help healthcare professionals and patients make clinical decisions. The goal of an accurate prediction model is to provide patient risk stratification to support clinical decision-making with the hope of improving patient outcomes and quality of care.By using the drug dataset to build a model that predict the outcome of the drugs that might be accurate for the patient.

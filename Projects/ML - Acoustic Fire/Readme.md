# Acoustic Extinguisher Fire Dataset #

## SHORT DESCRIPTION:
The dataset was obtained as a result of the extinguishing tests of four different fuel flames with a sound wave extinguishing system. The sound wave fire-extinguishing system consists of 4 subwoofers with a total power of 4,000 Watt placed in the collimator cabinet. There are two amplifiers that enable the sound come to these subwoofers as boosted. Power supply that powers the system and filter circuit ensuring that the sound frequencies are properly transmitted to the system is located within the control unit. While computer is used as frequency source, anemometer was used to measure the airflow resulted from sound waves during the extinguishing phase of the flame, and a decibel meter to measure the sound intensity. An infrared thermometer was used to measure the temperature of the flame and the fuel can, and a camera is installed to detect the extinction time of the flame. A total of 17,442 tests were conducted with this experimental setup.

Acoustic Fire Extinguisher is a type of fire extinguisher which uses sound waves to extinguish the fire rather than using the chemical compounds used by traditional fire extinguishers.This type of extinguisher can be more safe than the traditional ones as it doesn't use any chemical compounds which can cause health risks or property damage. With the current development, Acoustic Fire Extinguisher is able to put off small fires but it's a great development for the start.
 
 ### Little Science behind

By focusing bass sound waves into a specific direction, the acoustic fire extinguisher ability to manipulate both oxygen and burning material is maximized. Because sound is a pressure wave that oscillates between regions of high and low pressure, the oscillation can be exploited to create a vacuum that separates air molecules from the sounds of the flame, putting out the fire.

Here we Analyse the effect of different frequency of a sound wave on diffrent fuel flames.
